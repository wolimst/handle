## Handle (한들)

Handle \[ha(ː)n-dle\] is a [Wordle][wordle-wiki]-like Korean word puzzle.

Handle is designed to use assembled [Hangul jamo][hangul-letters-wiki] (the Korean alphabet)
to make the word guessing process most natural to Korean language.
It is easy to recognize the result of a guess because the result is colored
_on each Jamo_ in an assembled letter,
although a Korean syllable is formed by combining multiple Hangul jamo.

There are several game modes, such as 오늘의 문제 (Daily play), 자유 모드 (Free play)
and 두들 (Du-dle, play 2 wordles at once, like [Dordle][dordle-game]).

### Are there any other wordle games?

- [Wordle][wordle-game]: The original Wordle
- [Dordle][dordle-game]: Play 2 wordles at once
- [Quordle][quordle-game]: Play 4 wordles at once
- [Kordle][kordle-game]: A wordle with unassembled Korean letters
